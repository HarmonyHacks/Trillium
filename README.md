Trillium will be a web based calendaring tool used by mutliple parts of the organization to manage retreat and rental schedules along with rooms in use by each event. Many events may occur at the same time on the hill using all or just a portion of the available spaces. The intent is to make managing these resources easier and more accurate. It would also be helpful to be able to measure all the bednights (defined at the event) automatically.

More information should be available at the hackathon.... 

currently the organization is using >> http://www.brownbearsw.com/calcium/ which does not meet their needs completely.
